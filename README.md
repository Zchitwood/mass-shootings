# mass-shootings

Objectives and Key Questions

Objectives-
To identify states with Mass shootings and recognize when and where police presence needs to be at a heightened state.

Key Questions-
1.       What states to most shootings happen in? 
2.       Are most suspects arrested? 
3.       Is there a season or time more shootings happen?

Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Tableau

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
Data Wrangling, Cleaning data: removed duplicates; found and resolved missing values; addressed mixed or incorrect data types.

Exploratory & Descriptive Analysis: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.

Exploring Relationships, Data prep for Regression Analysis, Regression Analysis Standadizing the data, The elbow technique, k-means clustering, Subsetting of the Data Time series analysis: Decomposition Testing for stationarity ( Dicky-Fuller Test / Autocorelation Test )Â¶ Stationarizing the Data

Derived new variables, Used aggregated data to create flags. Visualising data: Create histograms, line charts, and bar charts, Plotting a choropleth, Correlations Scatterplots Pair Plots Categorical Plots,

DELIVERABLES
Reporting results: Tableau presentation that explained the answers to questions as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations. Final Tableau Report: Include analysis findings, visualisation, conclusion and recommendations.

Data Source
The data for this dataset is sourced from Kaggle.com revolves around mass shootings across the United States. 

Data Collection
The data collection process for this dataset is continuous and ongoing, with updates expected on an annual basis. This regularity in updates ensures that the dataset remains current and reflective of changing market conditions.

Limitations and Ethics
Dataset shows incidents by state but not city. Analysis would benefit by recognizing if incidents were in more major cities.

Data Relevancy
This data was provided in the CareerFoundry Project Brief. This data collection fits the project's requirements since it is open source, contains geographical objects such as country and city.

Data Requirements
